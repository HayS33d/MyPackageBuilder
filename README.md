# MyPackageBuilder
This will build an SCCM silent installation packag from an MSI file

This works best  when you copy the PB5.HTA to the source folder.  I have had some issues with this working when the script is not in the source folder, this could be a group policy issues I am dealing with, however just copy the HTA and remove it when completed.
